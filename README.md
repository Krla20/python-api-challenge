--Latitude vs. Temperature

*The closer to the equator the hotter it is.

*Between latitudes -20 and 20 are the hottest temperature in the cities.

*The far a city is from the equator the colder it is.

--Latitude vs. Humidity

*The data seems to be spread and hard to define where.

*The cities with the highest humidity are located between latitudes 40-75

--Latitude vs. Cloudiness

* The cloudiness is everywhere depending of the weather changes

--Latitude vs. Wind Speed

*The colder the temperature is the more wind that blows

👍Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from Part I.

✔Narrow down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. Criteria for "Ideal Weather": A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70, wind speed less than 10 mph, zero cloudiness, drop any rows that don't contain all three conditions.
